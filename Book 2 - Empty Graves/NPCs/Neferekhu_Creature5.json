While Neferekhu is in the cage, she gains a +2 item bonus to her AC. Small or larger creatures can carry Neferekhu while she is in her cage. There is a short length of chain affixed to the cage, allowing her and her cage to be wielded in combat as a flail; doing so allows Neferekhu to use her reaction to make a bite against the target of a successful hit. If Neferekhu is wielded in this way, she can only be targeted directly if her cage is successfully disarmed from its wielder. If Neferekhu attempts to cast spells while being wielded as a flail, the spell is disrupted unless she succeeds on a DC 5 flat check."},{"id":"_16ykc4ahuco","name":"Hateful Glare","traits":"aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, misfortune, occult, visual","range":"","actions":"none","type":"defense","description":"30 feet.
