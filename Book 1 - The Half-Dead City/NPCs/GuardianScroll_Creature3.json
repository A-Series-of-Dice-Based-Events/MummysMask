A creature grappled by the scroll is blinded and is being strangled. The creature is suffocating and can't speak as long as its strangled. This prevents it from casting spells with a verbal component or activating items with a command component. Any attacks targeting a guardian scroll while it has a creature grappled deals half damage to the scroll and the other half to the grappled creature."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"n","size":"tiny","type":"construct","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"5 feet, fly 30 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":3,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":4,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"constitution":{"value":1,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":-4,"benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":1,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":9,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":11,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":8,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":9,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":19,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"hp":{"value":44,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":6,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"reflex":{"value":11,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"will":{"value":7,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"bludgeoning 6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"fire 6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"bleed, death effects, diseased, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"Converted by VaranSL","strikes":[{"id":"_1rs1vtd048f","name":"slice","traits":"agile, finesse, magical","attack":"+11 [+7/+3]","damage":"1d4+3 slashing plus 1d4 persistent bleed and Grab","type":"Melee"}]}
