An ahkhat occupies the same space as the structure and if it is moved 10 or more feet away from the structure, it takes damage equal to half the number of feet it is away from its bounded structure. At the beginning of its next turn, it immediately teleports and returns to the nearest space within its structure. The ahkhat is immediately destroyed if its attuned building is destroyed or if it's keystone is destroyed."},{"id":"_1xu5mvcqv2w","name":"Structural Mobility","traits":"","range":"","actions":"none","type":"offense","description":"An ahkhat can move through the walls, floors, and ceilings of a structure it is tied, except for material made of metal. If a portion of the structure is broken or damaged, it can not move through it until it is repaired.
