On a failure, the creature is disarmed of its weapon, which becomes stuck to the adherer's body; if the Strike was an unarmed attack, the creature’s limb sticks to the adherer’s body and the creature becomes immobilized. A creature must succeed at a DC 21 Athletics check to retrieve a stuck weapon. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes stuck to the adherer and becomes immobilized. A stuck creature can use an Escape action to try to free itself from the adherer (DC 21). If the adherer is subjected to an effect that deals fire damage, and fails the saving throw, it's adhesive body is temporarily disabled for 1d4 rounds, if anything is stuck to its body, it falls off."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"le","size":"medium","type":"humanoid","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"+2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"+3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"high","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"-3","benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"+2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"+1","benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":"9","benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"11","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"4","benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"10","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"18","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"56","benchmark":"high","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"9","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"12","benchmark":"high","note":""},"will":{"value":"7","benchmark":"low","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"Converted by VaranSL","strikes":[{"id":"_6ogce1ik15","name":"slam","traits":"agile, finesse","attack":"+12 [+8/+4]","damage":"1d8+4 bludgeoning plus Grab","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"Aklo"}
