The master takes half damage from all effects that deal Hit Point damage, and the shield guardian takes the remainder of the damage. When the shield guardian takes damage through this link, it doesn't apply any resistances, weaknesses, or other abilities it has to that damage; the shield golem simply takes that amount of damage. The effect ends if the target is ever more than 30 feet away from shield guardian or if the shield guardian spends an action on its turn with the concentrate trait to end the link. If either the shield guardian or the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, any damage from this effect is resolved and then the effect ends."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"n","size":"large","type":"construct","adjust":0,"description":"These clay golems have been enhanced with magic to protect their creator.
