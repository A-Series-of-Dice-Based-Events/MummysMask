A zombie that is mindless and not under someone else's control falls under their control automatically; otherwise, the zombie or its controller can attempt a DC 36 Will save to avoid it being controlled (whichever has the higher modifier). The target zombie is temporarily immune for 24 hours if successful. The attempt fails if the zombie is the same level as Heqet or higher.\nThe zombie remains controlled by Heqet until either is destroyed. Heqet can control up to 18 zombies at a time. If Heqet would control a number of zombies over this limit, they choose which to release."},{"id":"_1uwdre7u70m","name":"Create Zombie","traits":"concentrate, divine, evil, necromancy","range":"","actions":"none","type":"offense","description":"Heqet can create lesser zombies with a 1-hour ritual. During this time, Heqet chants and performs an unholy dance over the corpses they intend to animate. Unlike normal rituals, this doesn't require a skill check or Cost. At the end of this hour, Heqet can create one 11th- or 12th-level zombie, or two zombies of level 10 or lower. These are automatically under Heqet's control and count toward the limit of Command Zombie. Any zombies created by Heqet still count toward the XP budget of an encounter normally."},{"id":"_5ji01wy03js","name":"Shamble Forth!","traits":"concentrate, divine, necromancy","range":"","actions":"one","type":"offense","description":"Frequency once per round; Effect Each zombie controlled by Heqet Strides 5 feet (or Burrows, Climbs, Flies, or Swims 5 feet if it has the corresponding movement type)."}],"morespells":[{"id":"_2b8x5exuhef","name":"Cleric Domain","note":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"36","benchmark":"moderate","note":", 2 focus points"},"spells":["","","","disperse into air, pushing gust","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":""}],"alignment":"ce","size":"medium","type":"undead","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"silver religious symbol of Areshkegal","spellattack":{"value":"28","benchmark":"high","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"36","benchmark":"high","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"Divine Prepared","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","harm (x5); eclipse burst, finger of death","blade barrier, spirit blast, vampiric exsanguination","command, repelling pulse, summon fiend","bloodspray curse, divine wrath, freedom of movement","chilling darkness, circle of protection, fear","blood vendetta, see invisibility, silence","animate dead, command, ray of enfeeblement, ","chill touch, detect magic, guidance, read aura, shield"],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"6","benchmark":"high","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"low","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"+9","benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":"24","benchmark":"high","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"23","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"22","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"26","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"24","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"22","benchmark":"low","note":"","name":"Osirion lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"32","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"192","benchmark":"moderate","note":"negative healing"},"fortitude":{"value":"19","benchmark":"low","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"22","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":"28","benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"positive 12, slashing 12","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"Converted by VaranSL","strikes":[{"id":"_29txbgg4tg1","name":"fist","traits":"","attack":"+21 [+16/+11]","damage":"1d8+8 bludgeoning","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"Abyssal, Common, Necril, Osirian"}
