Originally crafted for a wizard dedicated to Horus as a reward from his pharaoh for his prowess on the battlefield, the falcon crown was believed lost when the wizard was struck down by an ancient blue dragon. Centuries later, however, archaeologists discovered the falcon crown among the ruins of lumen. Researcher-priests of Nethys acquired the crown shortly after, and when the Nethysian priestess Serethet became the Forgotten Pharaoh, she claimed the falcon crown for herself.\nThis crown allows you to cast a 4th-level <i>mage armor</i> as an arcane innate spell.\n<b>Activate</b> (Reaction) (metamagic); <b>Trigger</b> You cast an arcane spell; <b>Frequency</b> Three times a day; <b>Effect</b> You make a spell attack at +18 to hit against the target of your spell, dealing 4d4 force damage on a success (or double damage on a critical success).","items":"<i>armband of the golden serpent</i> (see below), <i>falcon crown</i> (see below), gold funerary mask worth 15 gp, and a <i>light brown elemental gem</i>","spellattack":{"value":31,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":39,"benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"arcane spontaneous","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","prismatic spray, reverse gravity, spell turning, telekinetic bombardment (4 slots)","chain lightning, disintegrate, dominate, feeblemind (4 slots)","chromatic wall, cone of cold, prying eye, stagnate time (4 slots)","enervation, fly, dimension door, stoneskin (4 slots) ","fear, fireball, haste, slow (4 slots)","dispel magic, glitterdust, invisibility, mirror image (4 slots)","command, magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, shocking grasp (4 slots)","acid splash, detect magic, light, read aura, shield"],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":2,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":4,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"constitution":{"value":5,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":3,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":4,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"charisma":{"value":9,"benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"perception":{"value":22,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"acrobatics":{"value":24,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":25,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":29,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":26,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":25,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"osirion lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":34,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"hp":{"value":195,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":23,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"reflex":{"value":24,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":26,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"fear","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"Converted by VaranSL","strikes":[{"id":"_289dsjn79ht","name":"staff","traits":"two-hand d8","attack":"+22 [+17/+12]","damage":"1d4+7 bludgeoning","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"Ancient Osiriani, Common, Osiriani"}
